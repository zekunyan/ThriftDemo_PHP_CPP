# Thrift Demo. PHP client call CPP server

## What is Thrift
Thrift is an interface definition language and binary communication protocol that is used to define and create services for numerous languages. It is used as a remote procedure call (RPC) framework and was developed at Facebook for "scalable cross-language services development". It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently to a varying degree and seamlessly between C#, C++ (on POSIX-compliant systems), Cappuccino, Cocoa, Delphi, Erlang, Go, Haskell, Java, Node.js, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Smalltalk. Although developed at Facebook, it is now an open source project in the Apache Software Foundation. The implementation was described in an April 2007 technical paper released by Facebook, now hosted on Apache.  -- From Wiki [Apache Thrift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Thrift)

## This Demo
PHP client call CPP server.

### Work Flow

1. PHP client call with Request.
2. CPP server response with Response.

### Thrift interface definition

```
namespace cpp TTG
namespace php TTG

enum ResponseState {
    StateOk = 0,
    StateError = 1,
    StateEmpty = 2
}

struct Request {
    1: i32 studentID = 0
}

struct Response {
    1: i32 studentID = 0,
    2: string name,
    3: list<string> infos,
    4: ResponseState state
}

service TTGService {
    Response getStudentInfo(1: Request request);
}
